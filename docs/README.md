## Introduction

*Denture Design Studio* is an innovative graphical platform designed specifically for dental students. It provides tools for **real-time denture design**, enabling students to create and refine denture models while receiving guidance from assessors. The platform also includes features for **self-evaluation**, empowering students to independently enhance their skills.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Design Tools**: Real-time graphical interface for designing dentures.
- **Self-Evaluation Mechanism**: Built-in feedback and analysis tools for students.
- **Assessor Integration**: Features to provide assessors' feedback on student designs.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy-to-use design tailored for dental education.
